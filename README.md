# 🧶 Welcome to Loopsy!

### 🌟 What is Loopsy?

**Loopsy** is an e-commerce website dedicated to providing a wide range of knitting products, including yarn, knitting needles, accessories,and patterns. This is my first website, inspired by my passion for fiber arts. As an avid knitter, I frequently browse yarn websites, which sparked the idea to create one of my own.
Knitting is a highly creative hobby, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to merge it with my love for programming.
